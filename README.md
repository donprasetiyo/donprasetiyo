DonPrasetiyo.com is a portfolio site that shows all of my personal projects, certifications, and more. It's built with NextJS, Tailwind, in TypeScript.

### Features

There are few worth-noting features that I added to this site:

*   **Sticky navbar**. You can try scrolling from top to the bottom and vice versa, and you will notice that the navbar sticks to the top and becomes smaller when you scroll down (on desktop), and goes back to normal when you scroll up.
*   **Three different theme options**. Try clicking the theme switch button on the navbar, and you can choose between three theme options: dark mode, light mode, and device settings. For example, when you select the dark mode, appearance becomes dark which is nice when visiting this site in the dark or at night. The device settings follows your device settings (Windows, Mac, Android, and more). Selected theme will be saved in your browser cookies, so you don't have to switch after every time you reload.
*   **Responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop**. I use some flexboxes to make the website easier to read on smaller screens, but I also have added some media queries and others to help improve the appearance when it is visited on the smartphone. I also made the reCAPTCHA responsive.
*   **Tooltip with dismiss button**. When you visit this site and a theme hasn't been selected yet, you will see a tooltip. After a theme is selected, configuration is saved on your browser cookies and this tooltip won't show. If you clear your cookies, the tooltip will pop up again after you reload.
*   **Scroll to element with anchor**. When you click the Project menu on the navbar, it will automatically scroll to my personal project list, with smooth-scrolling. The same thing will happen when you click the Contact menu.
*   **Contact form with EmailJS and reCAPTCHA**. It's responsive, and email would send directly to my email.
